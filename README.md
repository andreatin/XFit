# XFit

This app is a fitness companion that has two feeds where a user can see different workout ideas for different categories. In the future, it will be organized by muscle groups and allow the user to "like" the exercises and add them to their own personalized list

## Overview
This app allows users to see different exercises
### Description
FIT BUD is similar to other workout apps with the exception of being able to cater it to your needs based on what type of workouts you want. It ideally pulls data from an API and feeds it through constantly changing feeds to give users new content if you would like.

### App Evaluation

[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category:** Fitness
- **Mobile:** Having this as an app gives users the ability to follow the exercises anywhere they are and also easily get recipe ideas and save them to be accessed easily. 
- **Story:** This app provides users with a one place for everything appeal. Although many fitness apps are out there, they don't seem personal or practical and miss the special touch of providing helpful solutions to problems such as not knowing what to prepare for dinner on a specific diet. This app also is aimed to help those who wander the gym aimlessly and don't know where to start.
- **Market:** The market for this app is anyone that is looking for workouts/exercises and diet recipes 
- **Habit:** This shouldn't really have any addictive features besides the running feed. Perhaps a user can get caught in the constant scrolling looking for diet ideas or workout options. 
- **Scope:** Fit Bud is meant to be a one place for everything app that allows for users to get ideas to live a healthier life. It can be used by anyone who cooks/lives a diet and exercises. This app would be a bit challenging to create and may need some research especially if a potential api can be found that brings in the needed information. This app can be made simpler by not making it specific to a user and it would still be very functional and fun to create.

## Schema 
At this point (unit 9) The app contains the bare bones of the fitness page where the user can find various exercises for different muscle groups to be able to form a routine. 
The recipe portion of the app is yet to be done and hopefully an API call to a fitness/workout creator can be made to fill in the template I have so far.
